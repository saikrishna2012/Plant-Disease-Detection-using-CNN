# Plant Disease Detection using CNN

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify plant diseases from images across various crop types.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Early and accurate detection of plant diseases is essential to prevent crop damage. Manual inspection is not scalable or reliable.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a CNN model to classify plant leaf images by disease.
- Evaluate model performance on unseen test data.

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Used TensorFlow/Keras to build a CNN model.
- Dataset organized into train, validation, and test sets with 13 classes.
- Trained the model for 10 epochs, achieving over 95% test accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib

## 📈 Results
- Validation Accuracy: ~99%
- Test Accuracy: ~95%
